# MapStyler - Custom Map Style Editor üó∫Ô∏è

MapStyler is a browser-based map style editor, initially created to design a custom print and now shared as a fun, experimental project. While it started as a one-off project, I've tried to generalize it a bit for others to explore and customize their own maps.

## Try It Out üöÄ

## Acknowledgments üôè

This project builds on excellent open source tools:
- Map data: [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/)
- Rendering: [MapLibre GL JS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js)
- Geocoding: [Photon](https://photon.komoot.io/)
- UI Components: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

## About the Code üõ†Ô∏è

This is a fun little project shared "as-is"! Originally developed for a specific need, I have tried to expand it to be more general-purpose. While functional and useful for map styling, it's still somewhat experimental, and should be viewed as a prototype. There may be a few rough edges.
- Might contain some bugs üêõ
- Code could use cleanup/refactoring
- Performance optimizations possible

Feel free to experiment and improve! (PRs welcome)
